    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

    <p>
    I am Request Godi, a second-year BSc Computer Science & Applied Mathematics student at the University of the Witwatersrand. 
    I have a strong passion for technology, cybersecurity, and problem-solving, 
    and I enjoy applying my skills to create practical solutions that empower students and small businesses. 

    Beyond academics, I am an aspiring entrepreneur, 
    working on projects like digital freelancing platforms and energy drinks for students. 
    I thrive on hands-on learning, exploring web development, penetration testing, and Linux-based environments, 
    while continuously sharpening my technical and analytical skills.
